# optics-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for simulating and analyzing optical systems

## Overview
* beam-diameter-measurement-knifeedge: Notebook for knife-edge fit of a Gaussian beam to determine the beam diameter
* microscope-resolution: Notebooks for estimating the single-photon and two-photon resolution of laser-scanning microscopes
* light-sheet-thickness: Notebook for estimating the Rayleigh range of a light-sheet microscope

## Notes
* To switch from dark to white background of plots for the rendering on Github, it is necessary to rerun the Kernel with "plt.style.use('dark_background')" commented out
